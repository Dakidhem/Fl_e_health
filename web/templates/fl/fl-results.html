    Federated Learning Results: Our federated learning process utilizes the
    collaborative efforts of hospitals and doctors to train a global model for
    medical health and X-ray image analysis. Through this approach, we have
    achieved remarkable results. During the training phase, each participating
    hospital or doctor trains a local model on their own patient data while
    keeping the data securely on their premises. The local models are then
    aggregated to create the global model, benefiting from the collective
    knowledge of all participants. We have observed impressive training
    accuracy, with the global model achieving an average accuracy of over 90%.
    The testing accuracy has demonstrated excellent performance, consistently
    achieving accuracy rates above 70% in the 3rd round. Additionally, we have
    monitored the loss reduction throughout the training iterations, observing a
    significant decrease in the loss function. These exceptional results reflect
    the power of federated learning in harnessing the collective intelligence of
    healthcare professionals while preserving data privacy and security. Our
    approach enables hospitals and doctors to leverage a shared global model
    that continually learns and improves, leading to enhanced diagnostic
    accuracy and better patient outcomes.
